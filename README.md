A Python script to parse logs and remove unauthorized IPs.

# 🔧 Log Parser & Alert Script with Python

A simple yet effective Python script that simulates the responsibilities of a Security Analyst by parsing a log file containing allowed IP addresses and removing unauthorized IPs from the list.

---

## 📌 Project Description

This project is designed to:
- Parse a log file (`allow_list.txt`) containing a list of IP addresses with access permissions.
- Cross-check the file against a list of IPs that should no longer have access.
- Remove those IPs from the file.
- Overwrite the file with the updated list.

It demonstrates the use of basic Python file handling, string manipulation, and list operations — all essential skills for entry-level roles in cybersecurity, especially in SOC (Security Operations Center) environments.
